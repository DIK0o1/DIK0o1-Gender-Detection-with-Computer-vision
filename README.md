# Gender-Detection-with-Machine-Learning

We can use machine learning to detect the gender of a human using the facial appearance samples of men and women. Facial appearance is one of the common ways that we humans use to recognize the gender of another person.we train a model with high-level characteristics of human beings such as:

1.distance between eyes, nose and mouth
2.measurements of different parts of the faces of both genders.
